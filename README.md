## IITMDSA-DTM11-Final-Project
# E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation
This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis on an E-commerce dataset using the K-means clustering algorithm. The goal is to identify the optimal number of clusters (k) based on the maximum silhouette score and uncover purchasing patterns among customers.

# Dataset Information:

The data was collected from a well known E-commerce website over a period of time based on the customerâ€™s search profile.

# Variable Description:

Column               Description
Cust_ID              Unique numbering for customers
Gender               Gender of the customer
Orders               Number of orders placed by each customer in the past

Remaining 35 features (brands) contains the number of times
customers have searched them

# Work Flow

  * First Import the necessary libraries needed for the project. Below are the libraries that I have used
    
        > import pandas as pd
        > import numpy as np
        > import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        > import seaborn as sns
        > from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
        > from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
        > from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
        > from yellowbrick.cluster import KElbowVisualizer
    
   * Load the dataset using pandas.
     
   * Understand the data with basic statistics, info, total records, features and their data types also number of null values.
     
   * Perform the data cleaning techniques like treating the missing values.
     
   * Visualize the data with the help of Matplotlib or Seaborn to get better understanding of the features.
     
       > In my project I have used Seaborn's
       > Boxplot(To visualize the Outliers present in the data)
       > Barplot (To get to 10 customer ID based on Total searches)
       > Countplot (To get gender count and Prior orders count)
       > Heatmap (To find the Correlation)
       > Histogram (To get know how the data is distributed)
       
# CONCLUSION:

In E-commerce customer segmentation the k-Means clustering plays major role for identifying the purchase pattern based on customer interest ,Here I used silhoutte score for finding an optimal cluster number to predict the right n_cluster. After that I split the two types cluster 1 is previlge to moderate customer and cluster 0 is low-set of interest in purchasing
